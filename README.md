# JavaScriptAssignments
A collection of the JavaScript Projects I was assigned to do by CodeHS. CodeHS is a website that easily teaches programming & computer science and is used by many schools. This was for my programming Class in High School. Now added are these blocks of code I ported to C++. Everything is ported except the SnowmanGraphic file, of which I don't have any plans to port that one due to time constraints.
